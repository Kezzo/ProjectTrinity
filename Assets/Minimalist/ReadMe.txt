After importing the package, if you see any major artifacts in the demo scenes, It’s more likely because the lightmap data is corrupted. Rebaking the light should solve the problem. 

If you are in Lightweight render pipeline, you must need to switch the materials to a lightweight variant of minimalist shader. A lightweight variant shader is given in the package [Minimalist/v2/LightWeightStandard].
